## DON'T BE A DICK PUBLIC LICENSE
### TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just "Don't Be A Dick".  Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:
   - Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
   - Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.
   - Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.
2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work, share the love. Only an advanced microdick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's creator(s) a pint.
3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes you a Donkey dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would be helpful, and submit an MPR with a properly compliant explanation of what they've done.
